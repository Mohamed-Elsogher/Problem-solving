As you can see, the stack is a clean way of handling tasks, removing them, and eventually getting back to the beginning.

Stacks come with a cost: memory. For every item we place on the stack, we allocate a stack frame to it. Think of an array index. Each index is allocated space to hold something.

 If we keep adding and adding to a stack, we hold the possibility of running out of space, like a parking lot that is full. When that happens, we have an overflow, hence,
 
 the term “stack overflow”. This can lead to crashes and stuck processes.
