# What is a Linked List?
 linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains data as well as the memory address of the next node in the list.

# Node :
A node in a linked list consists of two parts:

data which denotes the value of the node.

next which is a reference to the succeeding node.

The first node of the linked list is called the head node. It is the starting point of a linked list.

The last node is called the tail node. As there is no node after the last node, the last node always points to the null.

A null pointer does not point to any memory location.
